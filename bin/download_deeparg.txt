IMPORTANT: how to download the deeparg database

1) $ git clone https://bitbucket.org/gusphdproj/deeparg-ss.git

then, go to the "database" directory, choose the version (v1 or v2)
and link the file "features.fasta" into the DIAMOND work directory

2) install deeparg, e.g. via conda

$ conda create -n deeparg_env python=2.7.18
$ conda activate deeparg_env
$ pip install deeparg==1.0.2
$ deeparg download_data -o /path/to/local/directory/
then look for the "features.fasta" file as above.

Download HTTPS URL for the deeparg.py script, necessary for using DIAMOND against the DeepARG database with makefile.diamond, and eventually parsing such output with makefile.deeparg

$ wget https://gist.github.com/5f3b236bd36acf7a5a7fcf3cff99a56d.git 

IMPORTANT: after running mirror_deeparg.py, have deeparg.py inside one of the directories listed in the $PATH variable.
N.B.: the python script "deeparg.py" requires python 3.6*-3.8*
